# Unit 3: A journal for math equations

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The client wants a journal to write down math questions that he find. He wants to edit them later if he thinks there's an addition to the question. He wants a login system for the journal and wants to change the details that he enters when he registers for the first time. Also he want to add the answers of the questions once he find them.

## Proposed Solution
Considering the clients requirements a GUI application seems to be the best option. For this I decided to use Python as a programming language since it is able to run on multiple platforms[^1].For GUI development kivymd would be very suitable as this GUI framework is structured in object-oriented format which makes the development easy[^2]. SQLite is used to manage user inputted data as it is an embedded, serverless relational database which means the program and the database can be both localized.[^3]

## Success Criteria
1. The journal should have a login/registration system.
2. The journal should be able to record math questions with a title, an answer and a memo.
3. The user should be able to view and edit journal entries later.
4. The journal entries will be displayed separately to each user.
5. The GUI should have a dark theme.
6. All the inputting data has to go through validation inorder to stop the user from entering a blank entry.
7. There should be pop up screens for the user registration.
