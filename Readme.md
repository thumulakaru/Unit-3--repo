# Unit 3: A journal for math equations

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The client wants a journal to write down math questions that he find. He wants to edit them later if he thinks there's an addition to the question. He wants a login system for the journal and wants to change the details that he enters when he registers for the first time. Also he want to add the answers of the questions once he find them.

## Proposed Solution


## Success Criteria
1. A login/registration system.
2. A black interface.
3. The journaL should be able to record math questions/answers/points/memo and edit them.
